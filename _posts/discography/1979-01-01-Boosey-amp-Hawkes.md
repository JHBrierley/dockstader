## Boosey &amp; Hawkes

The Boosey &amp; Hawkes Recorded Music Library (now Cavendish Music - www.cavendishmusic.com) contains music specifically written for use in Audio-Visual Media (advertising, television, film, corporate videos etc).  It is a business to business music service that is licensed to end users at set rates controlled by a separate society, MCPS (The Mechanical Copyright Protection Society).  The albums are not released commercially or sold for profit to the general public - income is generated via licensing and royalties from broadcast &amp; airplay. SBH 3073 & SBH 3083 are old catalogue numbers for the library and would have been written and recorded to be marketed to clients and royalties collected via MCPS/PRS.
