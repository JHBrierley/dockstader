### Eight Electronic Pieces

**Folkways SM 3434**

**1961**

Dockstader's crucial and remarkably advanced early concrete pieces, originally released privately. This particular recording has been re-issued on the Locust label with new liner notes. Tod Dockstader did the analog-to-digital transfer from the original tape, and Ernst Karel mastered the recordings for the Locust CD.
