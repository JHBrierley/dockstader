## ReR MEGACORP



catalogue_no: ReR TDDM2
date: 2005
title: Bijou (with David Lee Myers)
coverimage: bijou_cover.jpg
contents: A subtle, moody, rich and wide-ranging work, in which atmosphere, emotion and dramaturgy lead the ear far beyond music into a world of hints, evocations, anticipation and association and, in passing, reveal a complex metonymic language that, at a deep level, invokes that mostly unconscious lexicon of sound we have all absorbed collectively and subliminally in the course of a century of movie-going, television viewing, documentary recording and electroacoustic experimentation. Once sounds have been abstracted from events, they are free to act and interact as signs; they are no longer indications of the real. And from their use as indicators we learn new meanings (the low drone from Jaws, the shower strings from Psycho, a TV theme, these are all as directly meaningful to us as a barking dog or an approaching train; after 1000 movies, the sound of a helicopter has as many fictional as factual meanings, and these accretions make experience imaginatively richer). This is the language Dockstader and Myers explore, and although, in a sense, such signs are weightless (there is nothing there), nevertheless we cannot unhook them and inevitably they conjure fragmentary narratives, events, places, situations and meanings. Where their last CD (Pond) abstracted sound from the life (in fact, documentary recordings of frogs), this one invokes a fictional life invoked in a language of purely mediated abstraction.

title: Pond (with David Lee Myers)
coverimage: pond_cover.jpg
contents: Pond is  a collaboration between Tod Dockstader and David Lee Myers, born of a long written correspondence and a mutual affection for frogs between them which eventually spawned this programme of electronic/concrete pieces. The pieces are derived almost entirely from field (and swamp) recordings of frogs - choral and solo - processed, manipulated and organised in a million ways. David Lee Myers released a number of recordings in the 1980s under the name *Arcane Device*, where the musical material was derived from almost uncontrollable feedback systems. In this recording, Dockstader used computers to manipulate the sounds for the first time, with the assistance of Myers, and recently remarked that he 'realised that many of the old principles - slowing, speeding, pitch-change, reversal - were the same - but with much more control and better sound (and no tape hiss). Because it was faster and I could keep my belief in what I was doing, more fun.'
