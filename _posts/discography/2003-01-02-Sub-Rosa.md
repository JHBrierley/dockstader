## Sub Rosa



catalogue_no: SR 223, SR 228 &amp; SR 233
date: 2005
title: Aerial
coverimage: aerial_cover.jpg
contents: *&quot;Airwaves allow for a silence that is not dead, representing a presence even wthout a signal&quot;*</p><p>Dockstader has given up tape manipulation in favour of working with frequencies and computer composition. Unlike the cycle of 1960-65, these pieces no longer rely on interruptions, accumulations, and complex acceleration effects. Instead, we have slow, penetrating pulses that explore every corner with celestial thrills.
