## Creel Pone

&ldquo;Creel Pone began as the first ever reissue series for LP covers and related packaging items, with everything printed as closely as possible to exact 5/12 scale including the inserts, label ephemera, booklets. In fact everything but the LP labels and the LP itself. But almost immediately people wanted the missing element so Creel Pone began including the music inside the sleeve on a CD-Recordable. This makes the Creel Pone more expensive to produce than they are sold for; but really it's not about having anything to do with money but just a way for pure and great art both in vision &amp; sound to prosper and be discovered anew.&rdquo;</p><p>Creel Pone editions <a href="http://www.orkstorm.com/creelpone/">[http://www.orkstorm.com/creelpone/]</a> can be purchased through <a href="http://www.mimaroglumusicsales.com/labels/creel+pone.html">www.mimaroglumusicsales.com</a>
