This interview first appeared in ReR Quarterly 0402.

*Chris Cutler*: Why and how did you start doing organized sound?

*Tod Dockstader*: Is that what we're going to call what I did? I don't know if anyone knows that term, now.

*Chris Cutler*: But you adopted it -

*Tod Dockstader*: - from Varèse. He used it because of all the problems with the word "Music" - with a capital M: "But, is it Music" And there were all these labels, musique concrète, tape music, electronic music and whatnot, at that time. I was working in all those techniques, yes, but I was working in the sound, first, in the * sound*, and I thought Varèse's term covered what I was doing, best.

*Chris Cutler*: But not now?

*Tod Dockstader*: Well, now I suspect it was a kind of cop-out. Why I started was because I really wanted to make a kind of music, and I was worried about being an unlettered primitive and so I shouldn't call it any kind of "music," what I was doing. I wanted to make music out of sound, instead of sound out of music - which is what people who write Music intend to do. And, with tape, for the first time, I could do that. Of course, most of the world's people make music without writing it out first; they always have.

*Chris Cutler*: "Primitive" cultures

*Tod Dockstader*: Right. And I was a charter primitive. I was included, at the end, in a long programme on New York FM - this was early 'Sixties. They played Cage and Stockhausen and Schaeffer, Henry, Kagel and all, and at the end, after my little contribution, the host said something like, Well, any form that allows an unschooled primitive to make music can't be all bad.

*Chris Cutler*: You were "unschooled"?

*Tod Dockstader*: No. I hadn't gone to their school, a Music school. I'd gone to my own school: I learned cooking in the kitchen. I apprenticed as a sound engineer in a big New York studio, in the 'Fifties. I went pretty fast through that school because I'd already done film editing in Hollywood, and a film editor in a little studio has to cut a lot of sound. It was all optical sound in those days, but the principals were the same.

*Chris Cutler*: What kind of films were they?

*Tod Dockstader*: Animated cartoons. The studio was UPA, a little place across the street from the big Warner lot. I got the apprentice editing job because I could draw; I guess they needed an editor who could understand the artists. The studio's gone now, and the New York sound studio; so much is gone. I always felt comfortable in studios, at home right away.

*Chris Cutler*: Were you ever involved on the other side of the camera, with the visual side of film?

*Tod Dockstader*: I did a few original storyboards, on my own time, that were made into films. One was about an ice-cream salesman, drove a Good Humor type of truck around and got so he couldn't stand that same lame tune looping all day. So, he installed a pipe-organ in his truck instead of the jingle-machine. I wanted the organ to play the Bach *Toccata and Fugue in d*, but the staff composer said, no way, he wanted the credit. So he wrote a tune which wasn't much better than the first one. That was my first exposure to the business of music: they wouldn't let me play what I wanted.

*Chris Cutler*: What models did you have when you did begin to play what you wanted?

*Tod Dockstader*: I'd heard some early work in Hollywood, done by film-makers working with optical tracks, drawing on them. There were the Whitney brothers and a Canadian, Norman McLaren, working in the 'Forties and early 'Fifties. They drew these little soundtracks for their films, before tape. They sounded quite "electronic," whatever that was. And l'd seen and heard a film by the Barrons, *Jazz of Lights*, which *was* electronic, this was mid-'Fifties. It was all new to me, and at the same time it sounded somehow familiar: I knew how they did it. So, as soon as I got the chance, in New York, I started in.

*Chris Cutler*: Had you heard any musique concrète?

*Tod Dockstader*: I think I must have, at least on the radio in New York. Probably Schaeffer's '48 * Etudes* - the train thing and the saucepan thing - and the first Luening and Ussachevsky tapes of the 'Fifties. I still have the first LP of musique concrète; I think that was '60 or '61. But I'd already done my first *Eight Pieces* by then. 1 don't think I modeled my first work after anyone in particular, not consciously anyway. I just knew how to do it. In working on a Moviola, you could run tracks backward and speed them up and slow them down, and edit sounds. Before tape came in, and that's about all they wore doing, technically. What was important to me was they were doing this as music, what Schaeffer called "a new art of sound." That idea was my model.

*Chris Cutler*: He followed that statement with, "Am I wrong in still calling it music?"

*Tod Dockstader*: Yes. As I said, I worried about that, too.

*Chris Cutler*: And now Schaeffer has decided that he was wrong, after all-

*Tod Dockstader*: No. It's music. Maybe not DoRoeMi -maybe ImErOd -but still music. I was sorry to learn he finally decided he was 'wrong.' But he was carrying around that burden of thinking of music with a big M again, and that can wear you down. That, and his friend, Boulez, hitting on him, in print, that "wide-eyed dilettante" and "miserable amateur" business.

*Chris Cutler*: How were you treated by "official" musicians?

*Tod Dockstader*: - Better than that; they ignored me. I was, after all, an "amateur," maybe not wide-eyed or miserable, but - if they'd heard of me at all - just an engineer, not to be taken at all seriously. But that was OK. The only time it affected me was when I was running out of facilities, studio time, and I applied to the Columbia-Princeton Center, and got refusal letters from both Luening and Ussachevsky. I should have known: the establishment had the guns, they weren't about to lend any to some shoeless Zapatista. By "shoe-less," I mean I hadn't the credentials they would recognize.

*Chris Cutler*: Which is why your work isn't included in most of the official histories and lexicons of music?

*Tod Dockstader*: I suppose. I'm mentioned in a few. I was surprised to find myself in them, a self-taught old concrete-mixer like me.

*Chris Cutler*: What was so attractive to you about concrete source material?

*Tod Dockstader*: I liked acoustic sound, air-moving sounds. I like the way they breathe and occupy the space around them. Particularly when I slowed them down, all those fine partials were revealed, changing in time, with the room-tone in them, the music in them. Just changing the pitch of a sound doesn't reveal its secrets, at least not for me. For me, acoustic sound, working in it, there s a built-in something, emotion, in it. lt talks to me. And, practically, I had no synthesizer of any kind; practically no one did, back then.

*Chris Cutler*: But you did manage to use electronic sounds in your early work.

*Tod Dockstader*: I had one or two audio test-generators. The studio used them to calibrate everything. I used them for another voice, to compliment my concrete voices. Also, they were scale-less, untempered: you played them by tuning a big dial. At times, they were distempered, the way I used them-because they only did sine waves, pure tones, and I distorted them into all kinds of useful, raggedy waves and pulses, so they'd meld with the timbres of my concrete sounds. I had no prejudice for or against electronic sound, still don't. All that "purity" business in the 'Fifties and 'Sixties: "Don't bring that cat into our concert hall!" It made me tired. I used whatever I could get my hands on, even if only for an hour. And, because I worked in this commercial studio, I got my hands on some nifty sound-makers, like orchestral chimes, timpani, vibes - whatever was left behind after a session.

*Chris Cutler*: You played these instruments yourself?

*Tod Dockstader*: If you can call it that, yes. Sometimes, I played the chimes by blowing into them; the timpani, by spinning a half-dollar on its head. At the same time, I was recording my performances, and it was some kind of workout, running back and forth between the control room and this airdrome sized studio, trying to et it on tape. Because, I had to do this alone, when the studio was empty, usually at night after engineering a session. These were all rented instruments, musical instruments, an engineer didn't touch them. But, to me, they were simply sound sources, like un-oiled doors and amorous cats.

*Chris Cutler*: You had no studio of your own all this time, no equipment?

*Tod Dockstader*: I had a little hi-fi monaural tape recorder at home, and one of the first tube condenser microphones; it had a "Telefunken" label on it. The studio was going to throw it away because no one liked the sound of it, so it came to me. It heard a lot of the sounds that went into my music. I still have it. The only real instrument at home was my wife's piano; Beverly plays the piano very well. I played it with two tape-head demagnitizers on the strings. She was incredibly patient with all this. I left her piano all out of tune, but, by God, it had no residual magnetism left in it.

*Chris Cutler*: Then, how did you decide how to use these sounds? How did you structure a piece?

*Tod Dockstader*: At first, I had a bad time with that. I had to learn it by making all kinds of messes. Those first few little pieces, they seemed to take forever. I'd set up my sounds on a couple of machines - they were monaural, then - and mix to a third, and take that mix and mix it with more sounds, on and on, and I was having a fine time. And I'd come in the next day and listen to it: nothing. It was so thick you couldn't hear anything. So, I stopped mixing and just sat and listened to my unmixed sounds again, until I understood what they wanted to say. I learned to respect my orchestra. Somehow, over period of a month or more. we got together, my sounds and I, and the pieces started to emerge out of all that tape, I emerged them with a single-edged razor blade. I think I used more blades than Sweeney Todd; I cut mountains of tape out of those mixes. Like the old description of sculpting: to make a bust of Socrates, you get a big block of stone, and cut away everything that doesn't look like Socrates. In time, the mountains turned into molehills because I became surer of my mixes, going in.

*Chris Cutler*: So, you had no example to follow in composing?

*Tod Dockstader*: I had all the music I'd ever heard, and, when it came time for me to make some, I had my own feeling about it, which was the Yo-Yo theory of composition: you slowly let it out, and then you quickly pull it back in. More pedantically, you build tension over time, then release. The trick is in the timing and not breaking the string. I broke a lot of strings. But it was working.Then, sometime around my seventh piece, I heard Varèse's Poeme Electronique for the first time. I heard the economy and the richness of it, the risk and control - in eight minutes, so much. After that, when I did my eighth piece, I went very carefully, patiently. I even mixed at 15 ips for the first time. Everything had been at seven-and-a-half before that, to save on tape. Sounds silly now, I know, but to me it meant a big commitment: this was for keeps, now, because now I knew music could be made out of sound.

*Chris Cutler*: Did you ever meet Varèse, at that time or later?

*Tod Dockstader*: No. He called me up on the 'phone once, after WXQR had played the *Poeme* and followed it with my Eighth Piece, which I'd sent them on a tape. He said something about how nice it was to have our work played, and it was: for me, it was the first time, my first performance. He asked me if I'd do some engineering for him - they'd said on the programme that I was an engineer. I think he'd said we'd "collaborate" on something he was working on.

*Chris Cutler*: But you didn't.

*Tod Dockstader*: No. I never heard from him again. I think he was re-doing the tape for *Deserts* for the L.P., but he got all the help he needed at the Columbia-Princeton Center. A lot of doors opened to him in those last years.

*Chris Cutler*: Did his influence stay with you, in your work?

*Tod Dockstader*: In a way. Not so much in structure; he had his own, and I was already moving in my own direction in that. It was his - seriousness, his attitude toward tape music. It was worth the work, it wasn't a joke or a momentary blip in the history of music, as most people thought at that time. That attitude sustained me in my own work.

*Chris Cutler*: You said that broadcast with Varèse was your first "performance."

*Tod Dockstader*: I thought of it that way, because growing up in the 'Thirties and 'Forties, radio had been my concert hall. There was a lot of serious music on then; all the big orchestras were broadcasting live, every week. And now, it was the only hall my own music might be played in: where else? So, I sent out these dubs to the stations.

*Chris Cutler*: What was the reaction?

*Tod Dockstader*: Well, they played it. And I know three people heard it: myself, Varèse, and the station engineer. I know the engineer heard it because he played along with it, on the air.

*Chris Cutler*: He what?

*Tod Dockstader*: He treated it as an add-a-part composition, contributing a few tones with his test generator during the broadcast, some boops and beeps of his own. I thought I was going crazy: Wait a minute, that's not in the piece! But, it was typical of the reaction at that time: this isn't Music, it's a joke, let's have some fun with it. And it wasn't just my piece, he played over the Poeme, too.

*Chris Cutler*: Did this happen often to you?

*Tod Dockstader*: Only that first time, that I heard. They'd do other things, playing only half of my tape - the top half of a two-track stereo tape. The FM stations were all monaural, then, but they were talking about going multiplex stereo, so I sent them stereo tapes. And they'd run them through their compressors and turn them into total distortion, total fuzz. I don't know, maybe they resented me as an upstart engineer; the announcer would always say I was, before the piece was played. A station engineer had to respect music by a musician.

*Chris Cutler*: But you kept sending them tapes-

*Tod Dockstader*: Yes, There was a lot of activity on FM, then, programmes that would play new music, all kinds. My work got into some fast company: Cage and Stockhausen and Babbitt and all. They even programmed my Water Music with Telemann's and Handel's, I think that was someone's idea of a musical joke, or trying to provoke a riot, but I was pIeased. And, after a time, they asked me to do some interviews on the radio, and I struggled through them. Those were the only ones I've done, before this. This was all early 'Sixties.

*Chris Cutler*: I think you are being too modest! But you had no records out?

*Tod Dockstader*: I had one - well, two, if you count the one I made, myself. I knew how to master LP lacquers, so I did my first Eight Pieces, monaural, and made a hundred pressings, this was'61. I sold them door to door, among record stores in New York, and sent them around to the record companies as a sort of *fait accompli* demo, and Folkways fell for it and remastered and released it as Eight Electronic Pieces. So l thought I was really in business, now; I'd have no more trouble getting my work published. I should have realised: Folkways was a wildly eclectic label. My work was in there with LPs of African thumb pianos, gamelan music and whirling dervish chanting and what-all - all of which sold better than mine. At least,they didn't want any more from me. Nor did anyone else, for five years.

*Chris Cutler*: Those were the years in which you did most of the work that we have now?

*Tod Dockstader*: Yes. It piled up on me, like - a load. I felt like a peddler, lugging this big sack of things around with me, things no one seemed to want. I got some of it on the radio, but that was transitory: when the programme ended, it was gone - unless someone taped it off the air. I needed publication that would give the music a chance to last for a while. I kept sending tapes and acetates to all the record companies - and those stereo acetates were hard to cut, very time-consuming. Some of the companies never returned them and some of the tapes came back unplayed, I could tell. Even some of the FM stations started to back off, not just from my work but from any new music - the start of the present ice-age of FM, I guess. I got a call from a programme director at QXR that they weren't going to play any music later than Hindemith,so please stop sending them tapes. And then, finally, Owl showed up and lifted the load from me.

*Chris Cutler*: You'd sent them tapes?

*Tod Dockstader*: No. I didn't know about them. The offer came through a friend of a friend. So, I supervised the lacquer mastering in New York from my original master tapes. It took quite a while, what with test pressings to and fro - Owl was out in Colorado - and designing album covers, writing the notes and all. It was a great time for me, even though I didn't get any music done, any new music. But getting the records done, done well, for me was part of making the music.

*Chris Cutler*: Did they get any attention?

*Tod Dockstader*: There were a few reviews, very few. They ranged from bewildered to careful. The careful ones kind of liked it, with the suggestion that they shouldn't. Because it didn't fit: new music, then, was supposed to be either aleatoric or atonal, and what I'd done wasn't either one. It was even "tonal," in its own way, and rhythmic at times, which wasn't being done. So, they didn't know how to pick up my work, or even if they should - it didn't have a handle they could recognize. Later, in the early 'Eighties, the records got some informed reviews. But I didn't know about them until much later; they came too late to change things for me.

*Chris Cutler*: You'd stopped composing before that?

*Tod Dockstader*: Yes.

*Chris Cutler*: Why?

*Tod Dockstader*: Well - that's hard for me to answer. It wasn't the watery reviews or anything like that. I think - in a way, I just got bone-tired. I'd done quite a lot of music in a relatively short time. I'd almost lived in that studio for six, seven years, engineering by day and doing my music in down-time, nights, and weekends there. Concrete and electronic music was an expensive music to make, then; it cost a lot in time and money - too much money, in those days, for some one working alone. And time: not just composing time, but maintenance and repair. l was pushing those studio machines hard, and they were always breaking down and I had to stop and fix them right then, no waiting, so they'd be ready the next working day. A regular composer, what's the worst will happen? He breaks a pencil, he loses a few seconds. l break a big Ampex and you lose most of a day, or, in my case, your job if you can't get it working again. And the heat: those machines were all tubes, everything was tubes, then. The decks would get so hot you couldn't touch them and you'd have to turn them off to cool down for a while. It really was like a kitchen. I read, much later, where someone from those days - maybe Berio - said he couldn't believe he put in all that physical work that tape-music demanded. Of course, he had another way to make music: he went back to writing, as Stockhausen and most others did around that time, late 'Sixties, 'Seventies. I suspect many of them turned away with a sigh of relief. But, as I've said, I wanted to make music out of sound, not the other way around, even if I could have. And then, things were changing even while I was still at it. The "Glorious Junkshop," as someone called it, of concrete was closing. And it did.

*Chris Cutler*: The synthesizer arrived.

*Tod Dockstader*: It was arriving. In '64, I got a letter from someone named Robert A. Moog, inviting me to look at his new "instruments for electronics music composition" - his words - at the AES convention in New York. How he got my name, I don't know; this was before my LPs came out. So, I went, I looked, I saw a keyboard and a prototype wall of knobs and wires. I listened, and I got a sinking feeling that my kind of music was ending here. My peculiar skills were going to be obsolete, like a blacksmith looking at his first automobile. That keyboard: that meant the writers were going to take over electronic music. And so, we got Switched-On this-and-that and Dancing Snowflakes and all, in just a few years.

*Chris Cutler*: Did you ever work with a synthesizer?

*Tod Dockstader*: Once, when I was working on a - I guess you'd call it a commissioned piece for Owl, in'66.

*Chris Cutler*: That was Omniphony?

*Tod Dockstader*: That's what it turned out as, yes. A composer I knew wanted to turn some of my noise into Music, with an orchestra and all; Owl paid for the orchestra. Then we took those tapes up to Bob Moogs studio, upstate New York, and ran them through his Mighty Moog, trying to, as it turned out, produce something that was neither here nor there. That whole experience was one of the things that helped blow out any flaming desire to continue to make music at that time; it was really bad.

*Chris Cutler*: How 'bad'?

*Tod Dockstader*: Oh boy... well, I'll give you just one of the things that happened; it seems my co-composer liked to go into the studio, Gotham, late at night and play this work-in-progress for his, I guess, musical friends. And, one night, one of them went mad during the playback and smashed up the studio, put his arm through a glass-panelled door, and sprayed blood all over the place - and I had to go in and try to clean it all up before the studio opened in the morning. There were other extra-musical events like that. Anyway, I left the studio and I left him to finish the piece, which he did, and the LP came out and everybody was happy. But I was gone. There's one little part of the piece I like: the rest I can't listen to anymore.

*Chris Cutler*: So then you had no studio to work in?

*Tod Dockstader*: Right. I tried to go on for a while, cobbling together some equipment at home, working nights. I got a suitcase organ, a Gibson 'combo' organ, the same model Ray Manzarek played on the road, and I rewired it into an affordable synthesizer, or something. This was before suitcase synthesizers appeared, like the MiniMoog and the Arps. The keyboard I'd made so odd, distempered and unstable, that I felt at home with it. But what I was doing wasn't like anything I'd done, and almost no one liked it, the few that heard it. One, a musician I knew, said, 'What are you doing playing chords? What is this counterpoint? You're not supposed to do that.' Maybe he was right: the record companies I tried, a bit half-heartedly by then, had no interest in it.

*Chris Cutler*: Owl Records didn't take it?

*Tod Dockstader*: Owl had gone out of business by then, or evaporated or otherwise ceased to be; I never knew just what happened. They came back later, changed. Folkways went; the tiny royalties stopped; all my bridges burned. Later, I destroyed most of what I'd tried to do. I kept a piece of it, called it *Animated Khartoum,* which was a bad pun on my UPA days, and also because my rewired organ tended to produce Arabic sounds. lt had a nasal condition. That was the last "serious" piece I did.

*Chris Cutler*: That was what, 1970?

*Tod Dockstader*: About then. I'd left New York to work on sound and visual design for some big expositions, in Canada and the U.S. I shot film, stills, did a lot of soundtracks for that. Then, I got into making videos and film-strips (another obsolete form of communication, now) for educational publishers, writing and researching. I wrote and directed a lot of video programs on American history. I liked that, the subject. You may have noticed I have an affinity for the past.

*Chris Cutler*: And music?

*Tod Dockstader*: I did some, for the various things I wrote. Most of the music I used was Period - obviously, with history - and I couldn't improve on that. I'd compose something to solve a narrative problem. For instance, I used my old concrete skills to underscore the battle of Verdun, working from the soldiers' descriptions of how it sounded - the huge roaring and sighing. I'd write opportunities for my music into my scripts. I was using about everything I'd ever learned to do, in that work. It was good work for me; it was generally a good time for me. I was busy, the years went by fast. But then, the publishers started going for computer programs - here we go again - and I just wasn't Interactive enough for that. That was committee-work, and I'd always worked alone. And, just then, I got a couple of offers to do CDs of all my old work - the music.

*Chris Cutler*: How did you feel about that?

*Tod Dockstader*: Astounded. I hadn't listened to it myself, for a long time. I didn't know if the old master tapes would play, so I wouldn't agree to it until I'd hauled them out and listened to them.

*Chris Cutler*: How was it?

*Tod Dockstader*: Painful, at first. There was some deterioration of the tapes, drying out, and all those hundred of splices peeling apart. When I played them, little piles of iron oxide would appear beneath the heads and tape-guides, and I thought, there goes the music - rust to dust. So, the next time I ran them, I made careful analog dubs, the best I could do, on professional equipment, to new tape. Some parts were really bad, but I managed to get dubs from an old friend that hadn't deteriorated (the tape, not the friend) and replaced those sections; there were only a few. So then I said, OK we'll do the CDs from my new dub-masters.

*Chris Cutler*: How did you feel about the music, after so long?

*Tod Dockstader*: At first, I hardly heard it as music; all I worried about was the sound. How's this going to stand up to CD sound-quality? I told the producer, Tom Steenland, we'd have to release them as Historic Recordings, like Edison cylinders. But, after the CDs came out, a hi-fi magazine asked for copies to use as test records for rating new equipment - so, either l'd underestimated my tapes or overestimated the State of the Art. After I'd settled down, I started to hear the music again, and again and again, with all the DAT transfers to approve and the CD references. It was very strange: it was almost like listening to someone else's work. But I liked it. I began to hear what I'd wanted to do in it: it stood up, for me. And, after a while, for others. The first reviews were: Uh, what is this stuff? Where did this come from? One reviewer called it "free - form jazz," whatever that is. But, just now the reviews have been better by far than anything the music ever got in it's day. when it was made.

*Chris Cutler*: That's probably not very surprising - I think Varèse once remarked that the Composer was never ahead of his time, the public were behind it. Also - you have a new generation now, who grew up listening that way; for them it's not so strange.

*Tod Dockstader*: Still, I was stunned; I never thought it would happen. Most of these reviewers, and people I heard from were, as you say, young - young to me, anyway - most with a whole different background in time and music from my own.

*Chris Cutler*: Do you think there's a reason for that? - do you think your work is somehow close to the sensibilities of people with a group, or rock, background?

*Tod Dockstader*: I wasn't aware of that. I remember I got a couple of 'phone calls in the 'Eighties from someone, I don't remember his name, who said he was working in a group, composing, or trying to, and they were all listening to my LPs, and could I tell him what to do. I didn't know what to say to him, except, don't worry it, just do it. Because, I'd always worked alone, not even listening to other people's music then, let alone working in a group. So, what were they hearing in my music? I don't know; maybe - it's the hands.

*Chris Cutler*: "Hands"?

*Tod Dockstader*: Well - in painting, which I studied, seriously, in school, we used to say a painter we liked had "good hands." You could see his hand in the work, in the brush-work. This was early 'Fifties, with painters like DeKooning and Bacon; they had great hands. And, for me, like painting, making music was always a very physical thing, very tactile. I played those tape machines like a DJ plays turntables, rocking reels back and forth, pulling the tape through by hand. The only time I sat down was to edit - more hand-work - otherwise I was always in motion. Maybe, because rock is a hand-made music - isn't it? -they heard that in my work. I really don't know.

*Chris Cutler*: You mentioned Manzarek. Did you ever listen to rock?

*Tod Dockstader*: Yes, in the late 'Sixties, when they were starting to explore, the groups were trying new things. I even wrote an article about it, I guess it was the first one about "electronic rock." It was published in the old *Electronic Music Review*. I don't know if their readership knew what I was talking about, then. So, I heard a lot, saw some of the groups - the Doors, the Who, the Holding Company, a lot of others long gone now. But before then, when I was doing the music, no. When I was working, I didn't listen to any other music.

*Chris Cutler*: Why not?

*Tod Dockstader*: There wasn't time to listen to anything other than what I was doing. And, it was a self-protective thing, too. I had to protect my innocence - what the critics called my ignorance; I had to keep my ears clean. After I came out of the studio, finally, I started listening again. There was a lot of new music to listen to then. I even reviewed some of it.

*Chris Cutler*: In revenge?

*Tod Dockstader*: No, not at all. I really wanted to *like* everything. But I found out it was hard to write a 'good' review, much easier to write a bad one. Something about the English language: all the really colourful adjectives are bad, disapproving. And they were sending me these awful records, electro-pop and cosmic-nothing music. It got so I had to tell the editor - this was *The Musical Quarterly* - I couldn't do it anymore. People say reviews don't mean anything, record reviews, but these records *were* the music, itself - not just another performance of it - so these were the only reviews the music was going to get. I think to go on doing that, a reviewer has to be someone who's never been reviewed.

*Chris Cutler*: How about now? What do you like of contemporary music?

*Tod Dockstader*: No. No more reviewing.

*Chris Cutler*: Alright, no names. Just generally.

*Tod Dockstader*: I haven't heard much new music, but, alright: most of what I've heard, instrumental and electronic, sound Neo-something to me: looking backward. Drone, and minimal, and New-Age-therapeutic - they were starting to do that back when I was reviewing, and I had trouble with it then. I didn't think it all would become so important. The minimal music I've heard recalls, for me, Schaeffer's locked groove Etudes - more ornate, but still... It conjures up images from Fritz Lang's film, *Metropolis*: all these people being sequenced like automatons, endlessly labouring away. Very sad, a mis-use of human beings. Some of it's pretty. But, no.

*Chris Cutler*: What other non acoustic musics have you heard? Any computer music?

*Tod Dockstader*: I'm not just sure what that is. I heard a little, when I was writing my notes for the CD booklets. Someone had come up with the phrase 'Computer Concrete' and I wanted to find out what that was. I asked a computer composer and he said there was no such thing. So, later, he came out with a CD of his computer-concrete music, so named. Hm. The little I've heard, I have trouble with. Digital sampling, unless it's very fast, staccato, sounds dead to me, truncated. Because, I feel real-world sounds, as they call them now, have to exist in time: they have a lifetime that has to be respected. If you slice them into a single-cycle loop, you'll lose that lovely timbral change over time, you lose most of the life in the sound. And then, you pitch-change this snippet down a keyboard? So you can have a chainsaw doing Ave Maria? This is the liberation of sound?

*Chris Cutler*: Hugh Le Caine did 'Happy Birthday To You' using only the scream at the end of Berg's Zulu: but admittedly, that was meant to be a joke.

*Tod Dockstader*: Yes, forgive the outburst. I think it's because I expected too much. After all this time, I thought they'd have come much farther with the Liberation. They say it'll be better, all they need is more memory. I think I have too much: I remember the promise. So, all this seems a little sad to me, a failure of nerve, somehow. I probably just haven't heard the good work; all I have are store records. Very likely, the good stuff is piling up in someone's closet.

*Chris Cutler*: Do you ever think about starting again?

*Tod Dockstader*: Very good, a change of subject, thank you. You mean, start piling up my own closet again? Yes. Just now, I'm starting to work on a new piece - starting all over, I should say. Years ago, I had to dump all my original materials, the miles and miles of tape that went into the music I did, my "samples." There wasn't anyplace to store it all, and what was I going to do with it, anyway? So, I'm beginning to collect some new sounds again, toward an idea I have. God knows how long it will take; I'm using mostly old equipment, salvaged analogue.

*Chris Cutler*: Could you describe the piece?

*Tod Dockstader*: No. There's no piece yet, only pieces. And I wouldn't, if I could. The work, itself, is enough for me now, more than I thought I would have again. Work for my hands and ears, grand, tedious work. So, finally, I feel lucky: to have lived long enough to see the music come back - to have avoided being in the old joke, where the composer walks into the publisher's office with his music and is told, "Come back when you've been dead a hundred years." I didn't have to wait that long - although music, making it, involves a lot of waiting: you do what you can, when you can, and then you have to be able to wait for things to come to you, ideas, whatever will. Sometimes, wait without hope. I believe I started doing what I did around the time Schaeffer stopped. When he began, he called it "musique," and then decided it wasn't. When I began, I didn't call it music, and now I do. So, I think, after all, I've maybe had a better time.
