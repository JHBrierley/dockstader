Two Moons of Quatermass were spin-offs from *[Quatermass]({% post_url compositions/2015-03-18-Quatermass %})*: they were flung out, in the long process of editing, as outs. Later, after *Quatermass* was done, I went back and edited them into the *Two Moons*. 

They separated themselves from the main work because; the first *Moon* was too languid to work with *Quatermass*, and the second *Moon* was more playfully chaotic than *Quatermass*.
