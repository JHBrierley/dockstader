Four Telemetry Tapes are the last pieces of truly organized sound that I did - though they're almost entirely &quot;electronic&quot;:three rewired audio test generators, played by twisting dials and knobs. The original idea came from recordings of early satellites, starting with Sputnik: the messages they sent back to earth, &quot;telemetry,&quot; were, to my ears, in the form of loops, slowly and subtly changing over transmission times. I constructed a lot of these loops, and started to mix them - and managed to create an early form of what became New Age music: restful, but, to me, dull. So, as I had with Drone, I threw out the score (but kept the title) and began to improvise, trying to find out how far I could push those three generators. The loops would have been much easier, as it turned out: almost every note had to be cut into shape, on tape: attacks, sustains, decays - my &quot;envelopes&quot; were hand-made with a razor blade and a steel straight-edge, and so much splicing tape that the original tape is often entirely white. The tapes were finished just about the time that the first &quot;personal&quot; synthesizers became available, along with sequencers - and all that work was instantly made obsolete. But it was fun to do, fun to push those primitive means so far into what became the immediate future.

 - Except for three notes on a guitar, the sound sources were entirely three test generators, rewired into instability. The fast tone-strings in the second Tape were made by cutting quarter-inch tape into miniscule pieces and splicing them together - so I might have twenty or forty splices in a foot of tape. The third Tape is, primarily, two generators set to beat against each other. The fourth Tape is a form of &quot;loops&quot; (which was the &quot;telemetry&quot; idea I began with) and is about everything I could get those three, poor generators to do (one died during the composition).
