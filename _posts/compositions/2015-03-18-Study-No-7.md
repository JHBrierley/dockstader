Study No. 7 was the seventh of my first "[Eight Pieces]({% post_url compositions/2015-03-18-Eight-Electronic-Pieces %})" and the first I composed in parts. It was more planned than the first six, which were largely improvised on the fly and then cut and re-cut into shape. I can hear in it pots and pans, oil wells, doors, laughter, water, and some things I have no idea what they were, so I guess it was the first piece in which my "style," if I can be said to have one, appeared.
